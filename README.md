# 🚗 Ackodrive Web Scraping, Data Cleaning & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** starting from **web scraping real-world data** from the Ackodrive platform to **cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing insights** using Python.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical skills in:
- Web data extraction
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization for business insights

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Online automobile platforms like Ackodrive contain valuable market and pricing information. However, this data is not readily available in a structured format for analysis.

**Objective:**
- Scrape automobile-related data from Ackodrive
- Clean and preprocess the raw data
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Generate meaningful visual insights to support decision-making

---

## 🌐 Data Source
- **Website:** Ackodrive  
- **Data Type:** Publicly available automobile listings and related attributes  
- **Collection Method:** Web scraping using Python

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Web Scraping**
   - Extracted raw data directly from the Ackodrive website
   - Stored data in a structured tabular format

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Standardized columns and data types

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed trends and distributions
   - Identified patterns and outliers

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created clear and insightful charts
   - Converted raw data into actionable insights
